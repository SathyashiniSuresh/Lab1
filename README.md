## Things I've written

Hi! I'm Thya! One of my proudest accomplishments as a writer was an article I wrote about a woman who defied her parents' expectations to follow her true passion for art.Her parents wanted her to pursue a more stable and traditional career path, bt she chose to listen to her heart and chase her dreams of becoming an artist.  The story resonated deeply with me because it captured the universal struggle between choosing security and following one's passion.

What made this piece even more special was its reception. Not only was the article published, but it also went viral on Facebook. To top it off, Simu Liu himself left a comment on it, which was a surreal moment.
